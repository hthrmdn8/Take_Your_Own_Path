  storyText: 'You find the fox slightly injured. You take it back home, and try to
    look for broken bones. You can''t find any, but there is a patch of fur missing
    with a large cut where the fur should be. With the fox in this state you stay
    up with it for 37 hours trying to make sure its safe. The fox has been eating,
    and drinking water. Every once in a while it even walks around your house. You
    pass out knowing the fox is getting more stable
