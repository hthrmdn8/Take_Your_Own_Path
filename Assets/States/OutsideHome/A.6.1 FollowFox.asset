  storyText: 'You follow the fox until it takes you to a large den..much larger than
    any normal fox den. You crawl inside to see what you can only assume is labyrinth
    of mystical pathways. Giant mushrooms with glowing lights peek out of one hallway
    while stone carves steps with teeny gnomes passing water  buckets up the side
    a "hill" nested beside one of the steps. The fox is gone.  What should you do?

    

    1.
    Ask the gnomes what to do

    

    2. Climb through the mushrooms to see
    if the fox went that way. '
