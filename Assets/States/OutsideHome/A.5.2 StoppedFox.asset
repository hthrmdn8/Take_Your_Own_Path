  storyText: "The little thing easily squirms out of your grasp, and looks at you
    almost puzzled. You stop to think about what you have done. Chasing a defenseless
    aminal through the woods only to try to catch it. You know better than that.
    You can either apologize, or try to leave. \r\n\r\nWhat should you do?\r\n\r\n1.
    Try to apologize to let the fox know you know you screwed up\r\n\r\n2. Try to
