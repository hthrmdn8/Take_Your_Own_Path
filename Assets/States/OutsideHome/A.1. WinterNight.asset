  storyText: "Outside your home on a cold night taking in the silence, and peace
    of the calm wind. A purple fox runs past you, stops, makes a quick glance at
    me then darts off. \r\n\r\nYou could chase it, or go to back inside.\r\n\r\nWhat
    should you do? \r\n\r\n1. Chase the fox to see where it goes. It's purple it
    has to be going somewhere exciting. \r\n\r\n2. Forget you ever saw it, turn back
    around go inside, and wish for a more simple world\r\n\r\n"
