You've walked just outside your home on a dark night. There is a purple fox that makes a quick glance at you then darts off.
Do you....

Chase the fox to see where it goes. It's purple it has to be going somewhere exciting. 
Forget you ever saw it, turn back around go inside, and wish for a more simple world
